# EBM DataLab's skeleton notebook environment


## Getting started with this skeleton project

This is a skeleton project for creating a reproducible, cross-platform
analysis notebook, using Docker.

Developers and analysts using this skeleton for new development should
refer to [`DEVELOPERS.md`](DEVELOPERS.md) for instructions on getting
started.  Update this `README.md` so it is a suitable introduction to
your project.


## Running Jupyter Lab

You will need to have installed Git and Docker, please see the
[`INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md`](INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md) for further details.

Windows and Linux users should double-click the `jupyter-lab` file.
Users on macOS should double-click `jupyter-lab-mac-os` instead.

This will build a Docker image with all software requirements installed,
start a new Jupyter Lab server, and then provide a link to access this
server.

The first time you run this command it may take some time to download
and install the necessary software. Subsequent runs should be much
faster.
